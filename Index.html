    <h1>How to Use Git and Github</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new repository in Github</li>
        <li>Clone a copy of repository on to your computer. This creats a new directory in your computer that is not conneted to your Github account online</li>
        <li>Creat a html or other type of file and same it in the directory created as a result of the cloning</li>
        <li>Stage, commit, and push changes in Git repository</li>
        <li>Create a pull request: This is a request to merge the code in a specific branch to the code in the master branch.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I plan to add more details to the above points later. That way this document can be a guide to new aspiring data scientists.</p>
